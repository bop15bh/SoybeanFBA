# SoybeanFBA
**The soybean FBA model (model_with_databases_subs.mat) used in  Holland et al. 2023 along with code for all analyses in the paper are in the Analysis folder.** 

Remaining directories are code required to construct soybean FBA model as follows:
1. Produce_Plant
2. Produce_Nodule
3. Nodulate_Plant
4. Constrain_Nodule
5. Finalize_nodule

Similar directories exist for the construction of the amide & ureide exporting version of the soybean FBA model:
1. Combine_models
2. Constrain_nodule_amide
3. Finalize_nodule_amide
